What I really need is keep all css and js files as they are (disable bundling)

I've got this URL mappings class:


  class UrlMappings {

	static mappings = {
        "/admin/$action"{
            controller = "Admin"
        }
		"500"(view:'/error')
	    }
    }

When I have start my application with default settings (bundling on), everything seems to be ok. Link to my source looks like this:

    /static/bundle-bundle_adminlogin_head.css //see the static prefix

When I launch the page in debug mode by adding ?_debugResources=y to params (equivalent to grails.resources.debug=true in config), than links are:

    /admin/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css?_debugResources=y&n=1362763478516
    /admin/css/bootstrap.min.css?_debugResources=y&n=1362764910238

Where the **static** prefix disappeared? I need it because this URL can lead to my Controller instead of the css file (even though in this case it is not true, but anyway). Can I set some config value to change it?

I wonder if there is any way how to keep all static resources in subdomain and
